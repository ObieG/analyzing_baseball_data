# analyzing_baseball_data program (python3)

I developed this program for Week 4 of the "Python Data Analysis" Rice University 
Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-analysis) which is part of the
Introduction to Scripting in Python Specialization 
(https://www.coursera.org/specializations/introduction-scripting-in-python).

Project Description:
The first project in this course required you to develop code for reading and 
writing CSV files using dictionaries. For this project, we will provide you with a 
several CSV files that contain data on the performance of Major League Baseball 
(MLB) player over a span of more than a century. You will build upon the work you 
did in the previous project to statistically analyze this data. This historical 
baseball data can be found at seanlehman.com in his baseball archive. The archive 
includes the raw data (stored in CSV files) used in computing most important 
baseball statistics.:

Notes given regarding testing:
Notice that the provided template includes a test_baseball_statistics function at 
the end. This code calls the functions you have written to compute top players 
based on various statistics. However, this code only works once you have written 
all of the functions and it operates on the full baseball data set. We strongly 
recommend you write smaller tests and utilize OwlTest to test each function 
individually. If something goes wrong, you will likely want to write smaller tests to 
help you understand how your code is working anyway. OwlTest uses smaller files to 
allow more targeted and understandable testing. You can use those files on your
own, as well.
